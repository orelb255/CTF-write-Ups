at first we start with nmap:
nmap -sC -sV -A <ip?
we see 2 ports are open: 85 (http) and 22 (ssh)  

then we proceed to fuzz the ip with gobuster:
gobuster dir -u http://<ip> -w /usr/share/wordlist/dirbuster/< choose which wordlist you like>
we see it found the /app directory
visiting that directory we see at the bottom right corner a login bustton.
